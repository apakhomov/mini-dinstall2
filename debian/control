Description: daemon for updating Debian packages in a repository
 This program implements a miniature version of the "dinstall" program
 which installs packages in the Debian archive.  It doesn't require a
 PostgreSQL database, and is very easy to set up, maintain, and use.
 mini-dinstall can be run via cron, or as a daemon.
 .
 This package is expressly designed for personal apt repositories, and
 the like.  In this vein, it contains fewer sanity checks; for
 example, it will happily install a lower version of a package.  You
 can also generally just 'rm' files from the repository, and
 mini-dinstall won't care.  In fact, (when run as a daemon) it will
 automatically detect that the directory changed, and update the
 Packages file.
